## Application Architecture

Maintainable code is:
- Intuitive – You look at it and it kind of makes sense.
- Understandable – If you look at something more complicated for a while, you can understand what it does.
- Adoptable – You want other people to be able to come in and make changes without feeling that the code is going to explode.
- Extendable – You can build on top of the existing code to do more things.
- Debug-able – Set up your code so somebody can step through it and figure out what it does.
- Testable – If you can write unit and functional tests, it will save you a lot of time.
